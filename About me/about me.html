  <h3>Computer Science</h3>
  <h3>Student at the University of the Immaculate Conception</h3>
  <h3>"I chose computer science as my course because I believe that through coding, I will be able to incorporate it with my other passions. I am also interested in Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacy, Pharmacuetical Botany with Taxonomy, Law, and Paramedicine. Through computer science, I want to pursue these passions but with a twist of "technology".</h3>
